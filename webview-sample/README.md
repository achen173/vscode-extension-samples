# SSED README

We created System Status Executive Display (SSED) so that you could see programs and process running on your computer directly from VS Code. This will allow you to optimize performance based on computer specs that are running at any moment.

## Problem

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular IDE and program for coding. Developers may run into issues with processing speeds and not be aware of programs running unnecessarily.

## Opportunity

End-users can use our product to run necessary programs and shut down processes that interfere with speeds and processing.

It is free and open-source.

## Features

Efficiency in programming ensures optimum performance.

* CPU
* Memory
* WiFi
* Running Processes Table
